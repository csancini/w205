    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this project is to analyze the Bay Area Bike Share Trips dataset to identify opportunities for offers that may increase bike ridership for the Ford GoBike company, which provides this type of transportation service in the Bay Area region. Currently, the company has three pricing options: a flat price for a single one-way trip, a day pass that allows unlimited 30-minute rides for 24 hours and an annual membership.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for analysis is publicly available on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) through the BiqQuery database, which includes three tables containing stations information, travel details between stations, and bike availability for each station. The documentation of tables and fields is available in BigQuery, hence there will be no explanations about them, unless they are necessary for the understanding of a finding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific research questions for the project are:\n",
    "- What recommendations of offers can be done to increase ridership?\n",
    "- What are the 5 most popular trips that can be called commuter trips?\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is structured in three parts. The first contains an executive summary of the main conclusions and offers proposed. The second part contains a detailed step-by-step analysis of the data that led to the main insights. Finally, the conclusion contains considerations for the implementation of the recommendations and for further analysis."

    "## Executive summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Offers may be targeted to people that are not current users of the service in San Francisco. Ads could be placed in locations close to busiest bike stations, such public transportation stations. Only the stations San Jose Diridron Caltrain Station (Sao Jose) and Mountain View Caltrain Station (Mountain View) have a moderate audience and are potential targets for ads outside San Francisco.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discounts could be provided for non-subscribers for trips starting at the early morning. Another option is to provide special discounts for subscribers that take trips starting in the late morning until the mid afternoon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Longer non-subscriber trips may be correlated with leisure, tourism, or exercise, and for this reason offers could be customized to reach audiences with those types of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shorter subscriber trips that may be correlated with commuting routes (customers use combined transportation by bike and train/boat). A communication strategy around wellness through short exercises combined with deals targeted to non-customers, could be effective as people would not need to change their routines too much to start using the service.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most popular commuter trips are concentrated in San Francisco between the following stations:\n",
    "- San Francisco Caltrain 2 (330 Townsend) **<>** Townsend at 7th\n",
    "- 2nd at Townsend **<>** Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building)\n",
    "- Steuart at Market **<>** 2nd at Townsend\n",
    "- San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th) **<>** Harry Bridges Plaza (Ferry Building)\n",
    "- Steuart at Market **<>** San Francisco Caltrain (Townsend at 4th)"

    "Bikes shortages can be an inhibitor for frequent or non-frequent users, who could stop using the service, or for customers who would not consider bikes as a regular transportation means. Additionally, further research is needed to identify whether the return on investment associated with increasing bicycles is justifiable, considering peak and off peak demand.\n",
